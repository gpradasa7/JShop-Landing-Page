            Gold chains were a sign of service to the supreme beings of a
            particular religion in the past. Nowadays, they are symbols of
            wealth and class. Rap artists were most likely the ones who brought
            the custom of wearing gold chains to modern men's everyday life.
            There are a few reasons why do men wear gold chains.

            A collection of hammered gold discs swing from the top and bottom of
            a shimmery gold hoop, creating a noisy fringe. Earring attaches to a
            standard fishhook fitting. Sold as one pair of earrings.Other hoop
            designs do not complete the circle, but penetrate through the ear in
            a post, using the same attachment techniques that apply to stud
            earrings.
